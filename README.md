## Secure Password Manager (Python)

## Description

SecurePass is a Python-based password manager designed to securely store and manage your login credentials. It prioritizes encryption, strong password generation, and user convenience to help you maintain robust cybersecurity practices.

## Features

Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 with a unique, user-provided master password. The master password is never stored in plain text, ensuring maximum security.
Secure Password Generation: SecurePass offers a password generator that creates strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets, minimizing the risk of dictionary attacks.
User-Friendly Interface: While this version focuses on command-line interaction, future iterations may explore GUI options for easier access and management.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python's portability allows SecurePass to run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.
Installation

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```
## Follow the on-screen prompts:

Create a strong master password. Remember, this is the key to accessing your encrypted data, so choose wisely and keep it secure.
Choose from options to add, view, update, or delete password entries.
For adding entries, provide website/service name, username, and secure notes (optional).
Security Considerations

Master Password Strength: The security of your passwords hinges on the strength of your master password. Use a long, complex password that combines uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager for your master password (ironic, but effective in this case!).
Encryption Library: Employ a well-respected encryption library with a strong implementation. AES-256 with proper key derivation and padding is a recommended choice.
Regular Updates: Stay updated on the latest vulnerabilities and patches for Python and the encryption library to maintain optimal security.
